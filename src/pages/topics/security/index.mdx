# Security

There are two main aspects to security:

- Data security
- Authentication

## Data security

Data security is about protecting the data from unauthorized access. This can be done by encrypting the data, using secure protocols, and by using secure storage.

## Authentication

Authentication is about verifying the identity of the user. This can be done by using a username and password, or by using a token.
