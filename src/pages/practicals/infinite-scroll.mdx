# Infinite Scroll Feed with Caching

## Scenario

Create a feed that loads additional posts as the user scrolls.

## Core Tasks

- Fetch next page when the bottom sentinel becomes visible
- Show loading indicators and an end-of-feed message

## Senior-Level Extensions

- Cancel inflight requests and de-duplicate pages
- Implement client-side cache with stale-while-revalidate logic
- Support optimistic "like" mutations with rollback
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Preserve scroll position across navigation
- Apply image lazy-loading, prefetching, and virtualization
- Write tests for race conditions and pagination integrity

## Evaluation Criteria

| Area         | Expectation                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Async Logic  | Robust cancellation, retry, and cache control |
| Performance  | Smooth scroll and efficient resource usage    |
| Reliability  | Handles flaky networks gracefully             |
| Architecture | Modular and cache-aware design                |
| Testing      | Deterministic, race-safe test coverage        |
