# Toasts and Modal System

## Scenario

Develop a reusable global toast system and a modal component.

## Core Tasks

- Toast: enqueue, auto-dismiss, manual close
- Modal: open/close behavior, backdrop, ESC and click-outside close, focus return

## Senior-Level Extensions

- Implement headless primitives (useToast, useModal) using context
- Add focus traps and nested modal handling via portals
- Support toast priorities, stacking, and motion preferences
- Ensure ARIA compliance and inert background for modals
- Provide RTL, theme, and reduced-motion support
- Add tests for focus management, timing, and accessibility

## Evaluation Criteria

| Area          | Expectation                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| API Design    | Composable and reusable primitives             |
| Accessibility | Correct focus and ARIA handling                |
| Resilience    | Cleanup on route changes and unmounts          |
| Animation     | Smooth, non-blocking, motion-safe transitions  |
| Testing       | Reliable accessibility and timing verification |
