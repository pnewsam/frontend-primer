# Debounced Search / Autocomplete

## Scenario

Implement a user search component that fetches suggestions from an API and supports keyboard navigation.

## Core Tasks

- Input triggers API fetch with 300ms debounce
- Display loading, error, and empty states
- Render selectable results list

## Senior-Level Extensions

- Abort stale requests and handle race conditions
- Prefetch likely queries when focused
- Virtualize large result sets
- Implement full ARIA combobox compliance
- Extract a headless useAutocomplete() hook and render prop component
- Add unit and integration tests for debounce, cancellation, and navigation
