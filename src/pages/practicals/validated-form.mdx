# Validated Form with Async Checks

## Scenario

Build a registration form with client-side validation and an async username availability check.

## Core Tasks

- Controlled inputs for email, username, password, confirm password
- Inline validation and disabled submit when invalid
- Asynchronous username check on blur

## Senior-Level Extensions

- Shared schema-based validation (Zod/Yup) with TS inference
- Cancel stale async validations
- Combine client, async, and server validations in one flow
- Add password strength indicator and i18n error handling
- Implement robust retry and recovery on submission
- Write unit and integration tests for validation and async behavior

## Evaluation Criteria

| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| State Management | Derived validity, minimal duplication          |
| Async Control    | Race-safe, cancellable validations             |
| UX               | Clear, responsive feedback                     |
| Architecture     | Centralized schema and clean structure         |
| Testing          | Comprehensive coverage of rules and edge cases |
