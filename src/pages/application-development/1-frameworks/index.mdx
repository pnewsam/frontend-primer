Every year, the browser becomes powerful, and Javascript and CSS become more feature-rich. You can accomplish a lot these days without using frameworks at all. And some people decide to take that approach. If you're building a full-stack application that relies primarily on server-rendered HTML, you might not need a framework at all.

But in practice you'll find that for most applications, frameworks like React, Svelte or SolidJs are a practical necessity.
